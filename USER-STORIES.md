###BusMall User Stories:

Marketing Team

As a member of the marketing team, I am looking for a user friendly product that will give us clear and usable data about the products that we are surveying. The site needs to be easy to use so that we minimize errors in our data that are due to a user making a mistake.

Developer

As a developer, I want to make an application that will take a given set of products and display them randomly, three at a time, on a browser and will react as a user clicks on them. As products are clicked a log needs to be made in order to track their popularity. This application needs to be able to be flexible to allow different products to be added and removed.

User

As a user, I want a site that gets to the point and just lets me click on products that I think are cool as quickly as possible so I can finish this survey and get on with my life. If it takes too long I'm just gonna close the page and get back to catching Pokemon.
